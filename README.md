# Snowflake Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my **end-to-end learning journey of Snowflake**, starting from core concepts to advanced analytics features.  
Each module focuses on **hands-on SQL + interview-critical theory**.

## 📘 Module 1: Snowflake Fundamentals

Module 1 covers the **foundation of Snowflake** — architecture, data loading, storage, compute, and semi-structured data handling.  
This module builds the base required for **real-world projects and interviews**.

### 📂 Contents of Module 1

#### 1️⃣ What is Snowflake
- Cloud-native data platform
- Separation of **storage and compute**
- Fully managed, scalable, and cost-efficient
- Supports structured and semi-structured data

📄 Notes: `Notes.md`

---

#### 2️⃣ Data Loading
- Loading data using stages and `COPY INTO`
- Understanding file formats and ingestion flow
- Hands-on practice with sample datasets

📁 Folder: `Data load`

---

#### 3️⃣ Databases, Schemas, Tables, and Views
- Logical hierarchy: **Database → Schema → Objects**
- Creating and managing tables
- Understanding views and materialized views
- Interview-focused differences between tables and views

📁 Folder: `Database, Schemas, Tables and Views`

---

#### 4️⃣ Virtual Warehouses
- Compute layer in Snowflake
- Warehouse sizing and scaling
- Auto-suspend and auto-resume
- Multi-cluster warehouses and concurrency handling

📁 Folder: `Warehouse and Stages`

---

#### 5️⃣ Stages and Ingestion Layer
- Internal vs External stages
- Named, table, and user stages
- Role of stages in loading and unloading data

📁 Folder: `Warehouse and Stages`

---

#### 6️⃣ Semi-Structured Data
- Working with **VARIANT, ARRAY, OBJECT**
- Querying JSON data using dot and bracket notation
- Using `LATERAL FLATTEN`
- Why Snowflake is strong for semi-structured analytics

📁 Folder: `Semi structured data`

---

#### 7️⃣ Snowflake Architecture (Conceptual)
- Cloud Services Layer
- Storage Layer
- Compute Layer (Virtual Warehouses)
- How Snowflake achieves scalability and isolation

📄 Notes: `Notes.md`

---

#### 8️⃣ Visual References
- Architecture diagrams
- Stage types
- Internal concepts explained visually

📁 Folder: `images`

## 📌 Outcome of Module 1

By completing Module 1, I have:
- Built a strong conceptual foundation of Snowflake
- Practiced core SQL and Snowflake-specific features
- Covered **most frequently asked interview questions**
- Prepared a solid base for advanced topics like performance optimization, security, and data sharing

---

## ⏭️ Next: Module 2
Module 2 will focus on:
- Performance optimization
- Clustering & micro-partitions
- Time Travel & Fail-safe
- Security, roles, and access control
- Real-world use cases and scenarios

---

✨ *This repository will evolve module by module as I deepen my Snowflake expertise.*
