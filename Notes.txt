1. What is snowflake?
Snowflake is a cloud-native data platform designed for scalable data storage, processing, and analytics.
It separates storage and compute, which allows multiple workloads to run independently on the same data without performance issues.
Snowflake is fully managed, supports structured and semi-structured data like JSON, and provides features such as automatic scaling, time travel, and secure data sharing.

2. Why Snowflake over traditional databases?”
Unlike traditional databases, Snowflake does not require manual infrastructure management.
Because compute and storage are decoupled, it offers better scalability, cost efficiency, and concurrency, making it ideal for modern cloud analytics.

5. Snowflake Warehouses
Virtual Warehouses in Snowflake are independent compute clusters that provide the processing power to execute SQL queries.
They do not store data; they only handle computation such as querying, loading, and transforming data.
Multiple virtual warehouses can access the same data simultaneously without impacting each other because Snowflake separates compute from storage.
